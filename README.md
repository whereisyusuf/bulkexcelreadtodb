# FunctionApp1
This is a C# Azure Function application that reads an Excel file from Azure Blob Storage, processes it, and saves the data to an Azure SQL Database.
## Function1
The main function in this application is Function1. It is triggered by HTTP requests (both GET and POST methods).

## Process
1.	The function starts a Stopwatch to measure the execution time.
2.	It reads an Excel file named sample4.xlsx from a Blob Storage account.
3.	The Excel file is read into a DataTable.
4.	The data from the DataTable is then saved to an Azure SQL Database using SqlBulkCopy.
5.	The function stops the Stopwatch and writes the elapsed time to the HTTP response.
## Setup
To run this function, you need to replace the Blob Storage connection string and the SQL Server connection string with your own.
## Dependencies
This function uses the following NuGet packages:
•	Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker
•	Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker.Http
•	Microsoft.Extensions.Logging
•	Azure.Storage.Blobs
•	ExcelDataReader
•	Microsoft.Data.SqlClient
•	System.Text.Encodings
•	System.Diagnostics
•	System.Text
## Logging
The function logs information and errors using the ILogger interface from Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.
## Response
The function returns an HTTP response with the status code 200 (OK) and the elapsed time in the body.
## Security
Please note that the connection strings and passwords are hardcoded in this code, which is not a good practice for security reasons. It's recommended to store sensitive data like this in Azure Key Vault or use Managed Identities.
